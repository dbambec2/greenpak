* Fix example after the move of __init__.py to driver.py

---

* Update the default config files with actual reading of factory reset devices.

* Add a more graceful handling of errors. Currently we assrt and exit.

* Add a tool with main() which can do basic operations such as programming a device.

* Add a function of readdressing a config. Given 256 config bytes, it sets the control code config
  based on user spec. This will allow to use the same config for multiple devices.

* Handle the id bits of the devices and complain if trying to program a non compatible config.

* Add a function to identity a device or config by their id bits.

* Add an example that interacts with a design at runtime (read counter value, set/reset FF, etc)
